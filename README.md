# My test Astro site
I'm trying out Astro just for fun because I heard good things about it. I'm creating a """"blog"""" using Astro. I'm simultaneously playing around with deploying via Netlify. If this survives more than an afternoon I'll hook up a Golang backend.

Deployed here: https://ryanastrotest.netlify.app/
